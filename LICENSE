BEER license / MIT license

Copyright (C) 2021 by Andreas Pfeil

The BEER license is basically the same as the MIT license (see below), except 
that you should buy the author a beer if you use this software.

“If you dine out, you give the waiter a tip, if you got to the barber, you 
give a tip for the service… The same applies here: If you like this software 
and want to honor the author’s efforts that went into this software, you should
send a motivation boost to the author by buying the author a beer. You can do
this by sending whatever amount a beer costs in your country. Sending a tip to 
the author is not mandatory. If you want to use this software but can’t or do 
not want to send a tip, that’s ok, too. It is completely up to you!”
